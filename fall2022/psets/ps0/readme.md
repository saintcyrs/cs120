# Getting Started with PSET 0

### Downloading the repo

You can get started on problem set 0 by using the Git command line utility to clone the cs120 repo.

`git clone https://github.com/Harvard-CS-120/cs120.git cs120`

You can then find problem set 0 in the directory `cs120/fall2022/psets/ps0`. For more information about downloading and installing Git see: https://git-scm.com/downloads

### Make sure to use Python3

For CS 120 problem sets, you should make sure that you are using [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). To verify that you have python3 installed, 
run:

`python3 --version`

which will output something like:

`Python 3.9.10`

Any Python3 version should suffice. **Older Python 2 versions are not compatible with the staff-provided test cases or autograder code.**


## Developing Solutions

The `ps0.py` file contains the starter code for developing your solutions. 
You can test your solutions locally by running:

`python3 ps0_tests.py` 

which will output a series of test results:

```
Test 1:  Failed
Test 2:  Failed
Test 3:  Failed
Test 4:  Failed
Test 5:  Failed
Test 6:  Failed
Test 7:  Failed
Test 8:  Failed
Test 9:  Failed
Test 10:  Failed
Test 11:  Failed
Test 12:  Failed
Test 13:  Failed
Test 14:  Failed
```

Once you are satisfied with your solution you can submit your `ps0.py` code to [gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/417853).
